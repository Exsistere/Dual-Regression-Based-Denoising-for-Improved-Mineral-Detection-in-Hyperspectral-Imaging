# Dual-Regression-Based Denoising for Improved Mineral Detection in Hyperspectral Imaging

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on enhancing mineral detection in hyperspectral images (HSI) using a dual-regression-based denoising approach. Hyperspectral imaging captures detailed spectral information, enabling precise mineral identification. The project addresses challenges like noise and high dimensionality in HSI data to improve the accuracy and reliability of mineral detection.


## Project Synopsis

This project was submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Technology in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Amity University Mumbai during the academic year 2024-25.

## Abstract

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers detailed spectral information across wavelengths for mineral exploration. This study examines the use of HSI for mineral detection, leveraging preprocessing techniques like noise reduction and atmospheric correction, along with advanced methods such as spectral unmixing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms. The project utilizes spectral libraries and machine learning methods, including support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and deep learning, to improve mineral identification. This implementation uses a dual-regression-based denoising method to enhance the quality of hyperspectral images, thereby improving mineral detection accuracy.
